# VO Data Publication Repository
This repository contains resource descriptors for publishing astronomical data via Virtual Observatory protocols using GAVO DaCHS.

## Motivation
The published data originate from small and medium-sized telescopes and are primarily oriented towards the variable star community.
Our main focus is on time-series data, complemented by related images wherever feasible.

## Repository structure

The repository is organised into *sub-repositories*, where each directory contains resource descriptors related to a particular data collection.

Production-ready versions are tagged and preserved.
