site.description: We publish data originated from small telescopes. \
Our primary focus is on time series with related images. \
Spectral data and catalogues of derived parameters will also be included. \
Observations with small and medium-sized telescopes remain meaningful \
in the era of large surveys and major facilities. Such instruments are \
widely distributed, and their relatively low operational cost allows \
long-term high-cadence monitoring of individual variable stars. \
This makes it possible to detect subtle features, transits, and even \
evolutionary processes. \
Our team is from Pavol Jozef Šafárik University in Košice, Slovakia
