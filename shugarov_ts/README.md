# Light Curves Collection from the Personal Archive of S. Yu. Shugarov
This repository contains resource descriptors for the publication of a light curve (time series) collection.
The collection originates from the personal archive of S. Yu. Shugarov (SAS, Slovakia).

The main scientific inters of the owner is cathaclysmic varibale.

We publish this archive with the permission of the owner and his collegues, 
who are convinced that archival observations should be accessible to the community.


The time series were derived from CCD images obtained with various small telescopes 
at different locations, mostly with the Zeiss-600 in Tatranská Lomnica, Slovakia.
The observations were carried out to monitor selected objects.

The time series were produced using a custom photometric pipeline.
Differential photometry was performed with comparison star magnitudes based on Landolt standards.

Each photometry point also contains a field, encoding the site and telescope where 
the observations were carried out.
