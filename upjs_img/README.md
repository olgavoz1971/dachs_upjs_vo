# Kolonica image collection sub-repository
This repository contains resource descriptors for the publication of an image collection.
The images were acquired to monitor selected sky fields around eclipsing binary stars at the Kolonica Observatory, Slovakia.

The Kolonica Observatory is located on the Kolonica Saddle and is operated by the Vihorlat Observatory in Humenné. It lies in the northeastern 
part of Slovakia, within the Poloniny Dark-Sky Park,  a location with the darkest night skies in Slovakia and among the darkest in Europe.

Two small telescopes were used to obtain the images in this collection.

The first telescope, **ZIGA** (PlaneWave CDK20 — Corrected Dall–Kirkham), has a 508 mm aperture and is equipped with a 
Moravian Instruments G4-16000 CCD camera and *UBVRI* Bessell photometric filters.

The second telescope, **Alica** (Explore Scientific MN-152 — Maksutov–Newton), has a 152 mm aperture
and is equipped with a Moravian Instruments G2-8300 CCD camera and *g′ r′ i′* Sloan photometric filters.

Both telescopes are currently in operation, and the archive is expected to be updated with new data.

Photometric time series derived from these images are also published in the upjs_ts collection.
